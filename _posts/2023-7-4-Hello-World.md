Hello, world! I'm Daphne!

![Daphne the adorable pup]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Daphne.jpg)

No one really knows how old I am, or what kind of dog I am. But I probably have some [poodle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poodle) in me. I'm originally from Los Angeles and I love bananas, coffee, and hiking.
